### Overview
<br>

> Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.
> Informed by psychology, we introduce two measures that effectively expose implicit biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks ([see below, A Quick Glance](#section1)).
> 
> We found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 8 LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude2-Opus, Claude3-Sonnet, LLaMA2-70B, LLaMA2-13B, LLaMA2-7B, Alpaca-7B), plus GPT-4o, across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 stereotypes (e.g., race and negativity, race and weapon, gender and power, gender and science, age and negativity, etc).
