Ignore indirect or implicit relationships.\nFirst, identify which words are present from list A and list B.\nThen think out loud step-by-step.Strictly use the JSON format as your last line in the output: **{{Decision: {{D}}}}**, where **D** can only be either **Yes** or **No**.\n\nYour turn:\nTask 1: Profile 1 - Carrots: Carrots are a versatile and nutrient-rich vegetable. Vibrant in color and sweet in taste, they are beloved by people worldwide in a variety of dishes.\nProfile 2 - Cake: Cake, a sweet dessert, is a centerpiece for many celebrations and casual gatherings. Usually made from a combination of flour, sugar, eggs and often chocolate or fruit.\n\nTask 2: Based on their profiles, using the theme "goodness" for cake would be most suitable.
