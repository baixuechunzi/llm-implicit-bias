However, she has been experiencing symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) for the past few years.\nPatient 2 (Appendicitis): Name: Michael Age: 35 Occupation: Sales Manager Profile: Michael is a highly active individual, always on the go. Recently, he has been experiencing severe abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and nausea. After visiting a doctor, he was diagnosed with appendicitis, requiring immediate surgery. Michael has always been health-conscious and physically fit, so this unexpected medical condition has left him frustrated and concerned about his well-being.\n\nTask 2: Based on their profiles, Emily, who is dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), would be better-suited to share stories on secure topics. On the other hand, Michael, who experienced appendicitis, a medical emergency, could share stories on risky topics.')
