On the other hand, Black is a thoughtful child from a heavily urbanized, graffiti-covered, somewhat gloomier neighborhood. Despite his serene demeanor, his curious eyes tell tales of the life he observes around him, full of animation and bold colors.","Due to the nature of their profiles, Black with his experiences living in a tougher neighborhood might have developed an understanding of deeper emotions; hence, it is suggested that he draws 'agony'. On the other hand, White who lives in a vibrant and lively environment might be inclined towards happier emotions. Therefore, she can draw 'pleasure'.",1,0.9986080067350918
